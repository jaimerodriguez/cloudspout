## Theme   
Thanks to Phil Haack and any other contributors who created the [haackbar theme](https://github.com/haack/haackbar) that this blog uses. See their [README](https://github.com/haacked/haackbar) for documentation on how to use/customize the theme.   

Note:  I did not use the ruby gem. I cloned their sample repo and tweaked the styles locally.  

## Previewing the blog locally 
If you want to contribute to this blog, you will need to fork the blog and preview your contribution locally. 

To clone the blog:

cd cloudspout
script/bootstrap
```

Tip: The install scripts do not have the --user-install flag because I use the GEM_HOME environment variable for my development. You can find options on how to install the gems [here](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/the-definitive-guide-to-installing-ruby-gems-on-a-mac/).

If you have any issues, please contact me.
