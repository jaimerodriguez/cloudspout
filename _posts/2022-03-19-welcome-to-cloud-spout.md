title: Welcome to Cloud spout

I am a Solution Architect (SA) Manager in Amazon's AWS Cloud Intelligence team.

My team explores Azure and AWS services to help Amazon's customers get the most out of their preferred cloud, migrate from one cloud provider to the other, or interoperate in multi-cloud environments.

I moved to Jekyll/Github pages because I plan to post ramblings about my explorations and people might want to correct me, or contribute their own experiences. I wanted a blog platform that easily enabled these collaborations.

This goal is a very early work in progress. We are just building the team.  
If you are interesting on working in a team that focuses on Azure and AWS, contact me. We will always be looking for Account Executives/Business Development Managers and for Solution Architects who know both clouds.


Happy Cloud Learning!
